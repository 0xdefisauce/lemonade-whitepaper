# The Banking System

After you have built up enough lemondade to stake your stand (10,000 PLACEHOLDER) and have deposited your AVAX, your stand stops producing lemonade, and becomes a bank. The bank will produce $LGOLD, which can be bought and sold on our own DEX.

## Compounding Game

Once your stand has been staked into a bank, your AVAX deposit will go into the Vault, and start compounding. Just like with Drip, you cannot withdraw your initial AVAX or Lemonade deposit. It is used to generate 1-2% daily interest based on the rarity and location of your newly aquired bank.

Each day staked, that bank will redposit your earned 1% into the vault so it can be compounded. When your Bank has generated the MAX_PAYOUT (total deposits multiplied by 3.65), you will be able to claim it and pay the tax, or restake it.

If you chose to claim you pay the 10% claim tax, and if you choose to reinvest it, then the process starts over but with a larger deposit amount to produce your 1-2%.

## Team System
