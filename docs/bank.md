# The Bank

The <span class="text-bank">Bank</span> is a mechanism that allows you to stake your $Lemonade and AVAX to earn <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span>, our deflationary token based on the excellent [Drip Network Tokenomics](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x786755E3a1DfcB121f754fFb9249095d9F4c9Ebf) that have been going strong for more than a year.

## How does the low risk, high yield CD work?

When you deposit your $Lemonade and your AVAX, the deposit goes to our Vault and becomes unavailable to withdraw. The Vault's job is to hold the taxes and deposits that is used by the compounding mechanism to pay out bonuses.

Each day, you can claim or recompound your 1% earning. If you deposited $1000 worth of AVAX and $Lemonade into the Bank yesterday, 24 hours later you can compound the 1% ($10) earned, and you now have $1010. 24 hours later you can compound the 1% ($10.1) earned, and you now have $1020.1.

## Compounding example

_note_: this example includes the taxes but not a change in the price of <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span>

Do that for 30 days and when it is time to compound, you will have a daily 0.166 <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span> ($10.50).

Do that for another 30 days and when it is time to compound, you will
have a daily 0.221 <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span> ($13.94).

Do that for another 60 days and when it is time to compound, you will have a daily 0.389 <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span> ($24.58).

Do that for another 60 days and when it is time to compound, you will have a daily 0.912 <span class="text-legendary">LGold</span> ($57.56).

From there you can keep compounding for better long-term gains, or start claiming your $60 a day until you hit the max-payout of your deposits \* 3.65. In a single month that would earn $1726.8, and you would still have access to another $1923!
