# What is the Lemonade Game?

## The lowdown

We are an NFT Staking game on the surface, but in reality, your NFT grants you the ability to produce our ERC20 token (inflationary) which you can then stake, along with AVAX (more coming soon!) to buy into a low-risk, high-yield CD ERC29 token (deflationary) with tokenomics modeled on our favorite DeFi protocol, https://drip.community!

## Our overall mission

We want our game to not only allow the gamification of successful DeFi protocols, but also to act as a mechanism of education, abstracting away the jargon and difficulty in DeFi. The longer the player plays the game, the more AVAX they can earn, and the more they will understand about how to interract with the fast-moving, strange lingo-using, complicated world of DeFi.

And course we want to make money, and make it over time, using the same game/protocol that our early adopts, investors, and The Tribe are using to grow their own money trees. So we are building the system around what we have learned from being involved and monitoring project previous to ours.
