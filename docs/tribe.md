# The Tribe!

We aren't just building a product or a "community", we want to build a passionate TRIBE of like-minded people who want to lifted with us like boats on the tide. We want to build the game and defi backend that benefits people like you.

Because people like us, love to be on the edge on new defi protocols and play to earn games, because there is nothing better than getting a return on your investment, and cheering each other on, and spreading information on how to optimize those gains!

## You are a NFT collector or flipper

We don't see this as a negative thing. You are a taste-maker, someone who sees around corners and can identify both current, and potential value. You understand how tokenomics and economics affect the NFTs market.

You are a educated investor, and we want to allow you to share that knowledge with us to build the best product we can, for YOU! You can improve the return on your investment by helping us shape the NFT part to fit the other properties you own that did well.

We welcome you to The Tribe with open arms!

## You love gaming and see the potential in play-to-earn

You are ahead of the curve, and also a taste-maker. While people are still talking about Apex legends you are thinking about DefiKingdoms and how to you increase your crypto holdings while playing an immersive world.

Or maybe you like mini games and the idea of shaping future phases to eactly what you would like to see. If so, our Tribe welcomes you!

## You are a humble farmer, looking for yields

The humble farmer gets slammed for acting in their own interest to crash the price of the token they are constantly dumping on the open market. But you are just not incentized to do what is in your investment's long term value.

We aim to change that, but giving you a way to participate in the protocol to earn percentages of taxes and fees people use while using the system and to outperform the other shit tokens that go to 0.

We want your voice and your presence in The Tribe!

## You are a saavy crypto investor

We want to give you the tools to make your yields! Since our game's back end is enabled from our own DEX, Liquidity Pools, and other staking devices, we can keep offering ways to buy into the ecosystem to earn those percentages and yields!

Let's build a great investment vehicle together, welcome to The Tribe!
